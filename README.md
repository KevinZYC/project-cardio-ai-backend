The Project Cardio AI is a neural network model trained to accurately predict calories burned in a workout session:
- make predictions using biometric data, body temperature, and heart rate
- trained with data from 15,000+ exercise sessions with varying body types and intensity
- accurate within 2.5 calories, or ~1% error

The model is deployed as a REST API through FastAPI and Uvicorn
